# PSP WiFi Controller
 This is the source code for an EBOOT.PBP designed to be installed and run on the Playstation Portable (Not to be confused with the PS Vita) 
that will allow it to act as a sort of WiFi controller for drone projects in which the drone emits it's own WiFi signal.
This project is initially designed for compatibility with mtbar379's Andrew project, a bipedal robot that emits a WiFi signal that will be used to control it.
I also intend to add support for the FRC control, to make a truly portable driver station.
